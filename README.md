# popos_full_update
This is a script I use to fully update my PopOS workstation and laptop. Just running apt-update and upgrade doesn't cut it...

# How to use
- Review the script and comment the sections about the software you don't use. 
- Run it from the command-line.

# TODOs:
- Provide config file to enable/disable software and provide configuration (path of config files, parameters, etc..).
  * Enable/disable automatic snapshot with Timeshift and/or other backup apps.
- Find a way to update:
  * Obsidian plugins.
  * AppImages.
